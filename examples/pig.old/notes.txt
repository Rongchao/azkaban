Notes:
-Register of job does not work due to an issue with the working directory not being a set-able in PigServer.
-Due to the same problem as above, the pig scripts should be embedded in the jar file.
-All the jars in the job directory will be added to the classpath automatically (for good and for bad), so if your pig job
	doesn't require the jars to be included on the nodes, it should work.
-If you need to register jars for serializing/deserializing of data, to work around the issue, you can add the jars in
	hdfs in a common directory and use the property 'include.jars' with a comma-delimited list of jar paths on hdfs.

	
We are moving towards a processed base grunt solution, which should fix a lot of our issues and make running pig jobs a lot
simpler.
